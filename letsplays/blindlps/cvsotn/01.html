Yep, this is a BLIND LP. I have NO idea what to expect/do. I mean, I know a bit of the story...But...Watch me fail.</p>
<br>

I've heard beautiful things about this game, and wanted to do a blind Let's Play! on it. I mean just listening to the *audio* doesn't disappoint one bit!
<br>

So, here I go to grab an iso...And burn it on Imgburn. Tested to be working (minor music issues) on Psxfin, or epsxe.
<br>

Yeah, I could play it on the emulator, but my laptop's too full with other crap already (Sims 3, why yew take so much spaaaace and reeesourceeees)
<br>

After a good hour or two failing the original PS1 swap disk method, I resorted to modding my PS2 (cheaply) and finally got my SotN backup to work!
<br>

Oh, joyous moment to see the Konami screen!
<br>
So, I reach the title screen. Lovely - it has accompanied music with vocals (as to be expected with the awesomeness & soundtracks to come.)<br>

And then I run into a <i>slight</i> problem...<br>

The game states my memory card as unformatted, and I can't get it formatted in game. <br>Damn third-party memory cards! Curse yoooooou.

Back to the drawing board....<br>

Okay! After MANY attempts, I FINALLY got the backup to work on my PS1. *Disk Swap method* <br>

Now, let's start for real.<br>

Alright! I cleared one block specifically for this game (I should really delete the others - I don't even have FF!) And it seems to be going good so far.<br>

So, let's name my file "Finnian" for now.<br>

<br><br>
At this point I used a different camera - the other was way too low resolution. <br><br>

The intro is full of major skipping issues. I just hope the gameplay isn't like that...<br><br>

<br><br>
I am treated to a "Now Loading" screen - and then, NOTHING! All I've succeeded in doing is making a coaster!<br>

I give up. I'm not going to make another coaster. It seems like I must use the laptop. <br>

I'll try again tomorrow and stick to something less headache inducing.
