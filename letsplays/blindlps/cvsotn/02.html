Okay, back to try again.<br>
I burnt another cd, just to try.<br>
So, I boot the game off my laptop, and it seems to be alright. <br>
Again, I tried it with the PS1 and it works! YAY!<br>
I start off as Richter Belmont (continuation of Rondo of Blood, I believe) at the part where you fight Dracula. <br>
And then the cheesy dialogue. Mm. Shakepearean-esque. The fight between the two starts after Drac's little "What is a man?" line and here we go. As you fight, you're expected to win. This means YOU CAN'T DIE (Or I *assume* you can't.) Maria Renard *WILL* come in and heal your ass if you died. She did for me. I don't know how many times this applies for, and the Dracula battle seems quite easy, but I keep jumping INTO Dracula when I'm whipping. Olololol.<br>
I also dig Richter's sprite (clearly short hair + headband) and his suddenly long wavy hair (and no headband!) in the talking cutscenes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Compare:</strong><br>

<br> <font color=red> <small>Richter SotN, Richter RoB, Richter Dra - well, the title's right there (with Maria)</small></font>
<br>
<br>Yeah, I know the artists are totally different. It's funny though. <br>
I die pitifully when he has only a little rainbow bar life left. Fail.<br>

<br><br>I beat him easily but...SotN doesn't like when I watch cutscenes. It hangs. Then goes black. Again. You know, maybe SotN just plain doesn't like me.
<br><br>
Douche.<br><br>

<br><br>
Starting from scratch:<br>
Okay, I'm going to do a Let's Play of Castlevania Symphony of the Night straight off the iso. I'm using ePSXe, PSXfin, etc. It's just a PS1 emulator (a good one so far.)
<br>
<br><img src="http://mintytentakuls.50webs.com/images/lpimages/konami.jpg"></img><br>
<font color=red> <small>So far, so good.</small></font> 
<br><img src="http://mintytentakuls.50webs.com/images/lpimages/richter-bloodlines.jpg"></img><br>
Starting with Richter Belmont again, I travel up the stairs, as per Castlevania protocal, and go into the last room: Dracula's throne room. He's a classy guy. Rich and Drac go into their "OUR JUSTICES ARE DIFFERENT." dialogue.

<p align="center"><font color=red> <small>Ololol. Hoomanz r DUM. U wunted meh nao u dun? WAT.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NO UR A LIER! </small></font></p>

<p align="center">
<font color=red><small>You're just upset 'cause they BBQ'd your wife. I mean, Richter doesn't give an EFF, Drac. See that hand motion?
</small></font></p>

<br><img src="http://mintytentakuls.50webs.com/images/lpimages/shpeel-5.jpg"></img><br>
<p align="center"><font color=red><small>OVERUSED LINE IS OVERUSED. Like that line right there.</small></font></p>
 
Battle ensues after Richter makes a highly negative remark concerning Dracula's unhealthy habits. Jk. Dracula initiates it.<br>
To be honest, his first form is typical Castlevania Dracula; disappears, reappears, and either: <br><br>1) shoots fireballs (that can be whipped) or <br>2)Those...rock...things...That I can duck/jump over.<br> <br>Pretty boring.<br><br>
And I didn't take any pics because it was that short.<br><br>

But after I destroy this form, he decides to cut the bull crap and tranforms into a monster thing (denoted by the 2nd life bar, lul) like other games, which normally makes him more difficult, but in this case, it's not.<br>

<img src="http://mintytentakuls.50webs.com/images/lpimages/dractransforms.jpg"></img><br>
<font color=red> <small>Richter's just chillin' till Drac's ready.</small></font> <br><br>

See, normally I *die* at least once because: <br>1) I suck <br>
2) To see the moveset<br> 
3) Both. <br><br>
I just saw 2 moves most times (his high jump that I can easily run under, and his three fireballs that I can dodge) and one other one another time and never again. Really easy.
<br>Like I mentioned before, you *MUST *win. It's very VERY easy to, but just to show you what happens when I die:
<br><img src="http://mintytentakuls.50webs.com/images/lpimages/rich-dies1.jpg"></img><br>
<font color=red> <small>Dude...Richter's on fire!</small></font> 
<br>
<br>Maria pops in, complete as a lawli in her pink dress, as Richter bursts into flames, logically. Says something with a REALLY mature sounding voice (SotN VA probably) while summoning her AMINUL FRIENZ.<br>
<small><strong>*Note:</strong><i> I ACTUALLY *DID* die legimately.
It was my first time using ePSXe and I wasn't used to the layout of the controls;
<br> D was Triangle, X was Circle, Z was X and A was Square. I had to configure the controls to be more vertically aligned.</i></small><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="pink">"SOMETHING SOMETHING LEND HIM YOUR STRENGTH (?)"</font><br>
Yes, that's little Maria Renard. I think she's 11? Give or take a few years. Still a LAWLI.<br>
<br>

<font color=red> <small>Richter lives!</small></font> 
<br><br>
Okay, after dodging, running, and then defeating Dracula's second form, I get to see the info about Richter, Maria, and how they beat Shaft and Dracula and how Richter disappeared after the events took place from another Castlevania game RoB (Rondo of Blood) etc.
<br>
<br> <img src="http://mintytentakuls.50webs.com/images/lpimages/recap.jpg"></img><br><br>
Basically, this is just a recap from the events that happened in that game (which I haven't played, but I've seen enough gameplay to figure out what's happening) in order to introduce the current events.
<br>
<br>The scrolling text cutscene ends, and I await to play Alucard. 
<br><br>Y'know, meaning, finally start the actual game (and confusion WOOT.)
