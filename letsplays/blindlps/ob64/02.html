I get treated to a cute sequence of little...Soldier people(?) smashing or chiseling a stone as the N64 booting up screen.
<br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/9c08ca5a.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>
D'aww. They're so cute and talented.
<br><br>
The game then shows who it's made by: Atlus and Quest. Atlus has published a few other notable titles, like Trauma Center and Quest (now defunct) has had this series (the Ogre series). I can already see similarities with this and FF Tactics. Well, many key members DID go to Square (later Square Enix)...
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/715ef185.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp;
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/c4b661a1.jpg" height="165" width="250">
<br><br>
Next thing I see is the title screen, or the mini introduction it gives me. I like short game intro screen things, what-do-you-call-'em. 
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/826d7181.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>
Fanks, I appreciate the text, y'know. Even though it IS a little vague...I guess I'll find out more later on, huh?
<br><br>
Finally, I get to see the start screen--And then something catches my eye. WHAT IS IT YOU ASK?
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/6722384d.jpg" height="340" width="500"> &nbsp;
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/660d1172.jpg">
<br> Bahahaha! I laugh in the face of your TUTORIAL! Psssh, as if I need one. Nope, not me.
<br> What?
<br> WHAT!?
<br><br>
Anyways, I start a new game and a sepia-toned cutscene appears before my eyes. There's sad music in the background and two guys are having a fittingly sad conversation....Or goodbye, as I learn later on.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/51256b82.jpg" height="210" width="295"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/a38dacc5.jpg" height="210" width="295">
<br><br>
It's hard to tell from here, but the guy near the top is named Yumil and he doesn't want the other guy leaving. His sad face and droopy shoulders cannot convince his buddy to...Not leave for the military academy.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/2851e8e3.jpg" height="210" width="295"> 
<br> I can imagine he's sighing heavily right now. 
<br>"Just...Just let me leave, dammit."
<br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/583dcd82.jpg" height="210" width="295">
<br><br>
The line he says after is that he's going "so I can protect both of us." Whether or not that's true, or just reassure his buddy over there, he walks offscreen as it fades into white.
<br><br>
Immediately after, white text appears to denote that six years have passed since then. I didn't manage to screen cap that message but I don't think that it's worth a picture when I can just say it. Later, it also states that it is the Graduation Ceremony of the Military Academy. YAY! 
<br><br>
Archbishop Odiron, an old man dressed in a green outfit that is probably mandated for his rank/clergy/class, who also uses an old form of english, is graduating the guy we saw before in the flashback in a room full of pretty statues and nice embroidered carpeting. Then, he asks for a name. My name. 
<br>
<font size="8">GASP! He was me the whole time.</font size>
<br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/eaf6e806.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>
It's nice to finally have some colour.
<br><br>
Speaking of colour, Mr. Protagonist over here is sporting some snazzy blue hair. I like blue hair on my RPG protagonists, I do say! 
<br>
On the name selection screen, the default name of the character is "Magnus". While that name does sound very excellently canon, this is my Let's Play so his name shall be something else that is also befitting the pseudo-medieval era this game is settled in.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/d9e79f2e.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>Yes, well--MOVING ALONG.
<br><br>
After confirming the name, I get asked many questions. Many, many questions. Only the D.O.B question brings me to different screen, so I didn't catch that screenie, but the rest come as a list which I do manage to snap pictures of. After each choice, your character confirms it by telling the Archbishop. For example...
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/2cf338d4.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/3ae66857.jpg" height="165" width="250">
<br>Yes. You have the best passion in your sword. EVERYBODY LOVES YOUR SWORD'S PASSION.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/536ad761.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/54f2afc0.jpg" height="165" width="250">&nbsp; 
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/3b32e213.jpg" height="165" width="250">&nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/27405cef.jpg" height="165" width="250">
<br>Because WHY NOT give the gods lust? I'm sure they'd rather have it then let a lowly human parading around in a lusty stupor whatamitalkingabout.
<br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/6594f6dd.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/7caa60a5.jpg" height="165" width="250">
<br><br> Those are also the things I selected. For anyone curious, I gave the character the D.O.B July 31, Trueno 18 (whatever that means). 
<br><br>
The interrogation of my character ends at that point, which then triumphant announces that the video game actually starts now, with an opening, epic adventure music and everything. Apparently, this game is IV in its Battle Ogre Saga. Here are a few screenies from the intro. 
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/9557192a.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/ba9f3fdb.jpg" height="165" width="250"> 
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/c77f9641.jpg" height="165" width="250">
<br>There always seems to be a "heroes in the sunset" image.
<br><br>
It looks like a short montage of my band of members/sortie/groupies traveling around the map to reach a destination, which happens to be a castle of sorts. Perhaps some are graduates from the academy, too?
<br>
Upon entry, we are welcomed to Palatinus by a blonde, moustachioed man named General Godeslas. His character mug looks like he's sneering. At us. What a jerk. I bet he's a jerk. Anyways, he goes on to say that Alba is the most rugged region in Palatinus.
<br>
He then gets off his fancy throne-esque chair thing and eyes us new recruits(?) judgmentally.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/9d0c9b7a.jpg" height="340" width="500"> 
<br>
Godeslas: It looks like some of you are graduates from the military academy in the Central Region...
<br> Why, yes. How sharp of you to notice that.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/ee79ca88.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/70389461.jpg" height="165" width="250"> 
<br>GodeSALAD: Did you think you could slack off? If that's the case, then I suggest you think again.
<br>Hey! That's pretty mean of you mister to be so accusatory on the first day. An-and was that a threat, sir!? It crushes my newbie heart, it does...Jerk.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/7679afd4.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>I already feel inadequate. Self-esteem -40.
<br><br>
After the General finishes berating the <strike>new troops</strike> me, he lets a guy named Ariosh take over. If what I know from RPGs is applicable here, then Ariosh looks like a very generic soldier.
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/6718af88.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>Non-descript appearance, dull facial features...Yep, generic.
<br><br>
Despite his generic-ness, I like Ariosh. He proceeds to read our names off what appears to be an unnecessarily large piece of parchment. 
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/17defb3d.jpg" height="340" width="500"> 
<br>Ariosh: You were selected as command candidates. Wait in the hall.
<br>You know, I don't think my name stands out at all. Not like Minnteur. Puh-leeeeez, grrrrl (or boy).
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/8e9a03fb.jpg" height="165" width="250"> &nbsp; <img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/6d7011d9.jpg" height="165" width="250"> 
<br>Cool, cool...
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/75b7e5c7.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>Well, er, I guess I have to understand...Seeing as I can't ask any questions. Why are you people so mean like this!?
<br><br>
With that said and done, the scene changes to the interview--I am guessing--where a grey haired old man is sitti-
<br><br>
<img src="http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/MikiTheKid/OB64/fb014d7f.jpg" height="340" width="500">
<br>Hm. That's oddly specific. How amusing.
<br><br>
Seeing as *I* am the protagonist, it's pretty obvious that I'm going first, you know? Also, seeing as there is quite a bit of dialogue...I'll try not to post too many pictures.
<br><br>

<br>Yes, Steve, I'm rather curious as to why this old man is doing this, too. Although, he might just be staring at my hair braid thing. Guys gotta compare dem man-braids. waitwat

<br>Hugo: Graduated from the Ischka Military Academy, eh?
<br>Why do y'all say it like it's a joke? I mean, seriously.

<br>I guess that was pretty straightforward, but...
<br>
<img src="http://tinyurl.com/cz64s23" height="340" width="500">
<br>Exactly.
<br>Since I'm too lazy to get the image here, Hugo responds with a "when you get older, you can tell a lot from a person's face..." before adding in a-

<br>...Interesting, old-man-I've-never met before.

<br>Well, uh, okay then...(What's with these guys and UNDERSTOOD?)
<br><br>
After I leave, one of the other characters that was assigned for this (Diomedes) enters and insults cool-old-guy-tactition Hugo before realizing that OOPS, he's a superior! You mucked up, Dio, you mucked up...
<br>
<br><img src="http://tinyurl.com/9tkzula" height="165" width="250">
<br>This almost amuses me. What a temper though, kid.
<br>
<br>At least with that the scene is finished. Finally. I don't like being interrogated. After this is where I actually start the game! But seeing as how much work it is to do it as text and images, the following will be in videos. That, and text doesn't translate my ideas all that well. And they don't seem as spontaneous. But that might just be me being boring.
<br>Maybe.
