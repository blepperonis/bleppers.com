            <p>The younger of the Antee twins (by a few minutes). </p>
            <p>Age: ~14 years old </p>
            <p>Gender: Male </p>
            <p>Family: Cream Antee (Sister), Steve Antee (Father), Honey Antee (Grandma, Father's side), Mama Rabbit
              (Mother) </p>
            <p>Likes: dressing up and looking cute, pinks and purples, cute animals, delicious food, cooking, and
              cute/handsome boys, hugs, stuffed toys, skirts and dresses </p>
            <p>Dislikes: mean or scary people, gross things </p>
            <p>Appearance: A redhead, usually, though his natural hair colour is blond like his sister and styled in an
              innumerable amount of ways depending on his outfit and mood. Fair skinned, with light freckles over his
              face. Large ocean blue eyes. Has a slim figure except for his posterior. </p>
            <p>Normally depicted with Holstein bovine features. </p>
            <p>Personality: Feminine, gentle and sweet. Immature and possibly a crybaby. Also a little bit vain in the
              sense that his appearance and style is very important to him, as he subconsciously compares himself to his
              sister. Not very good at being persuasive. </p>
