      <p>A bull who becomes the self-appointed adoptive brother of Boeuf.</p>
      <p>Age: Possibly mid to late 20s.</p>
      <p> Family: Boeuf (adoptive brother)        </p>
      <p>Likes: Boeuf, Violet, The Farmer, being outside</p>
      <p> Dislikes: </p>
      <p>Appearance: Has an  attractive, broad build. As a bull, he’s seen as strong and muscular but isn’t the largest of the lot.
        To the farm animals, he has a brown “coat” and goatee. Dark brown eyes. One half of the &quot;power couple&quot; on the farm.</p>
      <p>Personality: Has a fair, level-headed, if not relaxed personality. However, being a bull means he can be overprotective towards everyone and everything (even when not his business), which can get on a few nerves and also makes him prone to territorial issues. On some occasions, he can be a little excitable, however, though this usually involves the farmer.        </p>
      <p>History: Self-appointed adoptive brother of Boeuf, claiming the role after finding the boy abandoned by his real family and has since raised the younger since he was a calf. They maintain a close relationship despite the gap in age. 
        
        Arguably the coolest bull on the farm, admired by all the other animals and is especially close to the farmer, accompanying him whenever possible. This has caused some (strange) speculation from Boeuf and Loupe about their relationship, even though he has a mate in Violet.      </p>
      <p>At first, he is (reasonably) wary of the wolf girl Loupe, but after discovering her passive nature and irrational fear, he deems her as both "not a threat" and "nice" and approves Boeuf and Loupe's interspecies relationship.      </p>
